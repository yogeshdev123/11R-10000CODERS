          <h2>History</h2>
          <hr>
          <p><b>Founding and establishment </b></p>
          <p>
            In 1869, Goldman Sachs was founded by Marcus Goldman in New York City in a one-room basement office next to a coal chute.[6][7][8] In 1882, Goldman's son-in-law Samuel Sachs joined the firm.[9][10] In 1885, Goldman's son, Henry Goldman, and his son-in-law, Ludwig Dreyfuss, joined the business and the firm adopted its present name, Goldman Sachs & Co.[11] The company pioneered the use of commercial paper for entrepreneurs and joined the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1896.[12] By 1898, the firm's capital stood at $1.6 million.[12] It opened offices in Boston and Chicago in 1900, San Francisco in 1918, and Philadelphia and St. Louis in 1920.[13]</p>
<p>
Goldman entered the initial public offering market in 1906 when it took Sears, Roebuck and Company public.[12] The deal was facilitated by Henry Goldman's personal friendship with Julius Rosenwald, an owner of Sears.[12] Other underwriting work for initial public offerings followed, including those of General Cigar Company also in 1906, F. W. Woolworth Company in 1912, and Continental Can.[13][12] The firm was an innovator at establishing the price-earnings ratio, instead of book value, as a method for valuing companies, and was therefore able to raise funds for retailers and companies with few hard assets.[13]</p>

<p>In 1912, Henry S. Bowers became the first non-member of the founding family to become a partner of the company and share in its profits.[12]</p>

<p>In 1917, under growing pressure from the other partners in the firm due to his pro-German stance, Henry Goldman resigned.[12] The Sachs family gained full control of the firm until Waddill Catchings joined the company in 1918.[12] By 1928, Catchings was the Goldman partner with the single largest stake in the firm.[12] In 1919, the company acquired a major interest in Merck & Co. and in 1922, it acquired a major interest in General Foods.[13]</p>

<p>On December 4, 1928, the firm launched the Goldman Sachs Trading Corp.Ad, a closed-end fund.[14] The fund failed during the Wall Street Crash of 1929, amid accusations that Goldman had engaged in share price manipulation and insider trading.[12]</p>
